# Retail Sales Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze retail sales data to derive insights that could be vital for business decision-making. It focuses on evaluating sales trends, customer behavior, product performance, and overall store efficiency. The analyses are performed using SQL queries on a dataset that mimics real-world business scenarios.

## Dataset
The project uses the Northwind Traders sample database, a widely-used dataset for practicing SQL and data analysis. It includes tables for orders, customers, products, suppliers, and more, simulating a real business environment. The dataset can be found at [Northwind Database Source].

## SQL Queries

### Data Exploration
- **Objective**: Understand the structure and relationships of the dataset.
- **Queries**: Includes basic queries to list all tables, describe their columns, and explore relationships.

### Sales Analysis
- **Objective**: Analyze total sales over time, sales by region, and top-performing products.
- **Queries**: Complex queries involving `GROUP BY`, `JOIN`, and `ORDER BY` clauses.

### Customer Analysis
- **Objective**: Understand customer demographics and purchasing patterns.
- **Queries**: Segmentation of customers based on geographic and purchasing data.

### Product Analysis
